# Backlog

## Up Next

1. [ ] **Mobile nav redesign** — the header is getting cramped with 3+ nav items at 375px; we're currently just shrinking fonts as a stopgap. Needs a proper solution: hamburger menu, bottom nav bar, or collapsing nav. High priority — users are primarily on mobile.

2. [ ] **Guest predictions (no account required)** — users who don't want to sign up should be able to make predictions and see how they'd score. They won't appear on the leaderboard. Options: (a) store predictions in localStorage keyed by a generated guest token, compute score client-side, show a "you'd have X points" summary; (b) server-side guest session with a randomly-generated anonymous ID. Either way, guests should see a persistent "Sign in to save your predictions" nudge and be able to upgrade to a real account without losing picks.

3. [ ] **Custom domain migration** — Firebase Hosting custom domain + Cloud Run domain mapping. Update `authDomain` and OAuth redirect URIs.

4. [ ] **Team name truncation on 360px (Galaxy S24)** — "COLUMBUS CREW" clips at the narrowest CSS viewport; physical screen is 1080px but CSS pixels are 360px due to 3× device pixel ratio. Need a layout solution: smaller inputs, abbreviated names, or two-line team display.

5. [ ] **Profile page needs context** — currently just a display name form floating in space; add current prediction count, scoring summary, or other stats to make it worth visiting.

## Data & Polling

- [ ] **Real-data scoring accuracy test** — e2e scenario using actual 2025 Columbus Crew match results to validate the scoring engine against real outcomes. Get match data from user before writing.
- [ ] **Firestore match cache + score polling** — cache ESPN schedule in Firestore. Weekly refresh fires Tuesday midnight ET (cron) regardless of whether there's a match that week. When `kickoff + 2h <= now` and match not yet `STATUS_FINAL`, poll ESPN every ~5 min and write to ResultStore when final, then stop. ESPN already returns `status.type.name`.

---

## Test Infrastructure

- [ ] **Playwright smoke suite for prod** — identify a small tagged subset of e2e scenarios that can run against the live prod URL after deploy (replaces the current `curl` liveness check in `deploy-prod`)
- [ ] **Fix Vue Router warnings in unit tests** — test `makeRouter()` factories only register a few routes; components with `<router-link>` to unregistered paths (e.g. `/login`, `/signup`, `/reset`) trigger "No match found" warnings. Add stub routes to silence them.
- [ ] **Per-worker server isolation** — if the e2e suite grows large enough that serial execution is too slow, give each Playwright worker its own server instance (separate ports) so parallel runs don't share in-memory state.

## Decisions Made / Won't Do

- **Match result entry UI** — admin page not needed; `POST /admin/results` API is sufficient for now.
- **Bluesky AT Protocol auth** — dropped for v1. Complex, adds no value for first release.
- **FirebaseUI** — dropped. Incompatible with `firebase@11` (requires `^9||^10`).
- **templ/HTMX/Alpine.js** — replaced by Vue 3 SPA; `templates/` package deleted.
- **GCP Cloud Build** — GitHub Actions preferred; simpler config, already where the code lives, Workload Identity Federation handles GCP auth without stored keys.
- **Frontend subdirectory** — kept as single project root (`package.json` at root, `src/` for Vue).

## Done

- [x] **Typography overhaul** — replaced Bebas Neue with Barlow Condensed 800 (closer to official MLS/Crew aesthetic, works in mixed case); bumped font sizes across the board; fixed button vertical centering (flexbox, replacing asymmetric padding hack for Bebas Neue baseline quirk)
- [x] **Official Crew brand colors** — `--gold: #fedd00` (sourced from columbuscrew.com computed styles); nav link and muted text contrast improved (`#888`)
- [x] **Autocomplete attributes** — `autocomplete="email"` on all email inputs, `current-password` on login, `new-password` on signup; fixes password manager autofill and removes browser console warning
- [x] **Google sign-in redirect** — switched from `signInWithPopup` to `signInWithRedirect` everywhere; `getRedirectResult()` called in App.vue onMounted with try/catch so fetchUser always runs even if redirect result fails
- [x] **Mobile responsive layout** — cards stack at 390px and 412px; header stays single-row; Predict button full-width at 48px
- [x] **UX fixes — broken flows** — logged-out predict redirects to `/login`; 404 NotFoundView; score inputs gated behind auth; profile display name pre-populated; Google sign-in popup fixed
- [x] **Auth UX polish** — login/signup cross-links; error-state differentiation; logout UI; password-reset flow; display name / profile page
- [x] **Sign-up flow** — `/signup` view, `createUserWithEmailAndPassword`, reuses `/auth/session` cookie flow
- [x] **Google SSO** — Google provider + OAuth web client secret configured in Firebase Console
- [x] **Staging Cloud Run + artifact promotion** — CI deploys develop → staging (crew-predictions-staging GCP project); main promoted from staging artifact
- [x] **Staging Firebase Hosting** — frontend deployed to `crew-predictions-staging.web.app` so app origin matches authDomain; fixes Google sign-in redirect on staging
- [x] **Staging smoke suite** — post-deploy Playwright suite hits real staging URL; covers email sign-in/sign-up on desktop + mobile viewports; Google redirect initiation; two permanent test accounts with setup/teardown
- [x] **GitHub Actions CI/CD** — Go + Vitest + Playwright on push; Workload Identity Federation for GCP auth
- [x] **BDD e2e suite** — Playwright scenarios covering auth, predictions, leaderboard, mobile layout
- [x] **Server-side prediction locking** — 403 after kickoff; ESPN fetcher injected into handler
- [x] **Multi-competition support** — MLS, US Open Cup, Leagues Cup, CONCACAF Champions
- [x] **Match listings** — upcoming (next 7 days) + results with scores inline
- [x] **Leaderboard** — Aces Radio and Upper 90 Club formats; JSON API + Vue view
- [x] **Scoring engines** — AcesRadio (+15/+10/−15/0) and Upper 90 Club (+1 result, +1 Columbus goals, stacking)
- [x] **FirestoreResultStore** — match results persist across restarts; thread-safe stores with `sync.RWMutex`
- [x] **Firebase Auth** — email/password; session cookies (`HttpOnly`); Firebase Admin SDK with emulator support
- [x] **Vue 3 SPA** — MatchesView, LoginView, SignupView, LeaderboardView, ProfileView, AppHeader; Vite dev proxy
- [x] **Go server** — ESPN match fetching; Firestore prediction store; seed endpoints for e2e fixtures
- [x] **Industrial Black & Gold Brutalism design** — noise texture, gold stripe, Bebas Neue (now replaced), DM Mono scores, match card hover states
- [x] **Patch CVE-2026-34986** — upgraded `go-jose/v4` to 4.1.4
